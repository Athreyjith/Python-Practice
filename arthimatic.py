# friend = 3

# An augmented assignment operator in Python is a shorthand way to perform an operation on a variable and 
# then assign the result back to that variable. 
# It combines an arithmetic or logical operation with assignment in a single expression.

# friend = friend + friend
# friend += friend
# friend -=friend
# # friend *=friend
# friend =  friend ** 2
# friend **= 2  how many times it has to multiply
# friend= friend % 2
# friend %= 2
# print(f" {friend}")

x =3.6
y=-1
z=5

# result = round(x)  # display to the nearest value
# result = abs (y)  find the absolute value (+ive)
# result = pow(2,3)
# result = max(x,y,z)

print(f" {result}")
